# Welcome Contributors

Thank you for your interest in contributing to dw2ide_runtime! Regardless of the size of contribution, this will greatly enhance the project and is highly appreciated.

Before you start working, please read and follow this guide to ensure a smooth workflow for everyone.

## Types of Contributions

We are open to all kinds of contributions - from minor documentation fixes to major feature additions.
Specifically, we are looking for help with:

- **Code:** If you see something in our code that needs improving, by all means, go ahead. This could be cleaning up code, adding a new feature, or fixing a bug.
- **Documentation:** Enhancements to the README, contributing guide, clarifying unclear areas, fixing typos, adding missing information, etc.
- **Test cases:** Adding or improving our existing tests.
- **Issues:** Reporting bugs, suggesting new features, and discussing existing implementation strategies.

## Contribution Workflow

Here’s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork** the project. This creates a copy of the project under your own account.
2. **Create** a branch off of `main`. Name it something descriptive of the change(s) it contains.
3. **Commit** your change(s) to your branch. Please keep commits atomic: one major change per commit.
4. **Write** tests corresponding to your changes.
5. **Locally merge** (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch.
6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** with your changes against the `main` branch.
7. Write a meaningful **title** and **description** for the PR. If it fixes an issue, use the phrase `Fixes #<issue number>` in the description to automatically close that issue when the PR gets merged.
8. Ensure the **CI passes**. PRs will generally be considered for merging if the CI passes.
9. **Address feedback** from code review. If changes are requested, please respond to them.
10. Once your PR got approved, we will **merge your branch** into the `main` branch.

## Testing

We expect at least one new test per (external) Pull Request,
unless the PR only affects non-code content, or they contain works that have gained exemption status
such as non-running code that will be tested in later work (typically not targeting the main branch).

## Communication

We primarily use GitHub Issues and Discussions to discuss changes and track bugs.
If you have any concerns, please let us know by opening an Issue or a Discussion.
Bug reports are preferred to be opened as Issues,
while architectural changes or feature requests are preferred to be Discussions.

## Code Conduct

It's important we keep a healthy community;
please follow our Code of Conduct while preparing your contributions.
